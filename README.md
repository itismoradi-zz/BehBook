# BehBook
A program for better reading of books on certain days

## Description
We plan to read the number of chapters of a book with any number of pages in a few days. If we take the number of days as the vertices of a directional graph, its edges are the number of pages read from the day of origin to the day of destination. In addition, we can not read just a few pages of the book in a day, but must count the number of chapters that are read at the end of the day.

## Approach
With the help of this program and by navigating the graph, we want to find the optimal way to read the chapters in the day so that the reading of the pages in the days is numerically balanced.
